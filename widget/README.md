# Visa-Gate Visum-Finder 2.0 Widget
Our widget generates, with the use of the Visa-Gate API, detailed listings of wether there is a need for a visa or not
for a person to enter a specific country. The widget also provides the customs-regulations for each country selected.
It features the ability to get the information for one or more pessangers and for single- or multi-stage travels. Those
results can be exported as a PDF-file and send via email.

## Who can use our widget
Our widget is designed for both private and business use.
A private person can use it to check and plan their family vacation or business trip.
But it can also be used by travel-agencys to check wether their costumers need a visa or not.

## Price
Our widget is **FREE** to use for private and business purposes.

Corporate partners will get a coupon code. When this code is entered by the costumer in the checkout process, the
costumer will get a discounted partner-price and the corporate-partner will get a commission for the sale.

This means our widget does not only save money. It also allows value added sales.
